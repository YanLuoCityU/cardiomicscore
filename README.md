## Project Structure and Usage Guidance

### 1. `config/`
This folder contains the parameter configurations used for fitting different deep learning models. The final parameters for each model are stored in a corresponding `final_param.json` file.

---
### 2. `data/`
This directory stores all data-related files.
- `data/processed/`: Contains processed intermediate files (e.g., omics data, covariates, outcomes) ready for the next steps.
- `data/split_seed-XXX/`: Contains the final training, validation, and test sets after preprocessing and imputation for different cohorts. These are the primary datasets used for model training.
- `data/split_seed_raw-250901/`: Contains dataset splits created from the raw data *without* missing value imputation or full preprocessing. This subset is specifically used for generating descriptive baseline characteristic tables.

---
### 3. `data_loader/`
This module contains all code for preparing input features and outcomes.
- `OmicsGenerator/`: Scripts for extracting and processing omics features (Metabolomics, Proteomics, PRS).
- `PredictorsGenerator/`: Scripts for generating clinical predictors.
- `OutcomesGenerator/`: Scripts for constructing the outcome variables.

---
### 4. `model/`
This directory contains all code related to model development, from hyperparameter tuning to final training and benchmarking.
- `hyperparameter_tuning/`: Scripts for deep learning hyperparameter tuning, primarily using Optuna to find the optimal architecture and parameters for the MetNet and ProNet.
- `training/`: After tuning, scripts in this folder use the optimal parameters to train the final deep learning models (MetNet and ProNet).
- `baseline/`: Contains implementations of various baseline models, including traditional clinical scores and standard machine learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest), used for benchmarking.
- `coxph/`: Scripts to fit Cox Proportional-Hazards models to evaluate and compare the predictive performance of various combinations of multi-omics scores and clinical predictors.
- `fine_gray/`: As a sensitivity analysis, this contains scripts to fit Fine-Gray competing risk models to also compare the performance of various combinations of multi-omics scores and clinical predictors.

---
### 5. `analysis/`
This folder contains scripts for results integration and survival analysis. It processes the outputs generated by the models to produce summary statistics, comparison metrics, and data for final visualizations.

---
### 6. `saved/`
This directory is the central location for all outputs generated during the project lifecycle.
- `log/`: Contains various log files from data processing, model training, and analysis runs for debugging and tracking experiments.
- `models/`: Stores the final, trained model objects.
- `results/`: Stores all intermediate results generated during analysis, such as prediction scores, SHAP values, and performance metrics (`C-index`, etc.).

---
### 7. `visualization/`
This directory contains the master R Markdown script (`visualization.Rmd`) responsible for generating **all manuscript-ready tables and figures**. It reads the summary data from `saved/results/` and produces the final outputs in `results/Figure/` and `results/Table/`.

Key visualizations and tables generated by this script include:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Baseline characteristics tables.
- **Cohort Characteristics**: Plots of follow-up time and incident cases across datasets.
- **Survival Analysis Plots**: Kaplan-Meier curves and Hazard Ratio forest plots.
- **Model Performance Plots**: A comprehensive set of C-index and Δ C-index forest plots for main analysis, geographic validation, single- vs. multi-omics comparisons, and all subgroup/sensitivity analyses.
- **Model Interpretation Plots**: SHAP heatmaps and detailed beeswarm plots to visualize feature importance.
